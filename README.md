# FirstGame

This is my First pygame library game. Im hoping to create a simple fighting campaign game with my own animations. Before I begin creating the images with other software, I created a player obj and basic movement. 


To run the game you need to have pygame installed. This can be done with a simple: pip install pygame on the terminal
You probably will need to change the import player line depending on how you store the files. (line 3 in menue.py)
